#sample_list.pt
#List of files to be encrypted or decrypted
#Optionally specify a dir containing plain text files
PTPATH=path_to_plaintext_files	# DO NOT put this on the first line.
#Also optional, dir to contain encrypted files.
ETPATH=path_to_encryptedfiles

#Next the list of files and passphrases, these must be in strict order.
PT=some_plain_text_file.pt	# Always the first of the treble
ET=the_encrypted_file.en	# The second.
PP=your_very_large_pass-phrase_maybe_7_words_long	# The last.

# Repeat the above group as required.
# Once you have created your list file you should then encrypt it with
# crypt list.pt 'your passphrase for this encryption' list.en
# and then invoke it with:
# crypt -l[e|d] list.en 'your passphrase for this encryption'
# crypt will take care of the ordering of source and destination files
# depending on whether you are encrypting or decrypting.
# File names, pathnames and pass-phrases may contain spaces and will be
# enclosed with "'" when executing.

# Once you have encrypted your 'list.pt' to 'list.en' you should of
# course delete 'list.pt'. If you need to re-edit it you can always
# recover it with:
# crypt -d list.en 'your passphrase for this encryption' list.pt
# If you lose that master passphrase you are cacked.
# PasswordSafe anyone?
