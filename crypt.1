.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
\fBcrypt\fR encrypts or decrypts the \fIinputfile\fR using a key generated
by the passphrase and writes the result to \fIoutputfile.\fR

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
 \fB\-h\fR
print help information and exit.
.TP
 \fB\-d\fR
Decrypting mode. Due to the use of an initialisation vector when
encrypting, the process is asymmetric. So this option must be used when
decrypting a previously encrypted file.
.TP
 \fB\-s\fR
File to shred and delete. Shredding is never done automatically.
.TP
 \fB\-t\fR sub_dir_name.
Write the \fIoutputfile\fR to the named sub_dir in \fI/tmp\fR. This is
likely only useful when making temporary decrypted copies of files.
.TP
 \fB\-D\fR
Debug mode. Causes the hex representation of the sha256sums to be sent
to \fIstderr\fR. If you redirect this to a file note that such file will
be double the the size of the file being encrypted.
.TP
 \fB\-l[e|d]\fR \fIlist.en\fR 'pass\-phrase'. Decrypts \fIlist.en\fR and
encrypts or decrypts lists of files conatined in the list file.
