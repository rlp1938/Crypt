CRYPT
GNU Command
%%mtime(%Y-%m-%d)

= NAME =
**crypt** - crypt.


= SYNOPSIS =
**crypt** [option] //inputfile// 'pass-phrase suggest 7 words' //outputfile.//

**crypt** -s //file_to_shred_and_delete//.

**crypt** -l[e|d] //list.en// 'pass-phrase'


= DESCRIPTION =
**crypt** encrypts or decrypts the //inputfile// using a key generated
by the passphrase and writes the result to //outputfile.//


= OPTIONS =

:  **-h**
print help information and exit.
:  **-d**
Decrypting mode. Due to the use of an initialisation vector when
encrypting, the process is asymmetric. So this option must be used when
decrypting a previously encrypted file.
:  **-s**
File to shred and delete. Shredding is never done automatically.
:  **-t** sub_dir_name.
Write the //outputfile// to the named sub_dir in ///tmp//. This is
likely only useful when making temporary decrypted copies of files.
:  **-D**
Debug mode. Causes the hex representation of the sha256sums to be sent
to //stderr//. If you redirect this to a file note that such file will
be double the the size of the file being encrypted.
:  **-l[e|d]** //list.en// 'pass-phrase'. Decrypts //list.en// and
encrypts or decrypts lists of files contained in the list file.
